/**
 * Error reporting for the target app — what Part 2 of the design consumes.
 *
 * A production crash arrives at the crash compiler as an error plus a
 * BREADCRUMB TRAIL: what the user did before it broke. This module makes that
 * trail worth having. Two facts measured against the SDK (23 Sept) shape it:
 *
 *  1. The SDK's automatic breadcrumbs carry `{id, class, tagName}` and HTTP
 *     `{url, method, statusCode}` — never typed values, never `data-testid`.
 *     For this app, which identifies everything by data-testid, an automatic
 *     click reads `Clicked  BUTTON`. So the actions add MANUAL crumbs naming
 *     the testid and the value: those are what a generated test needs.
 *  2. The buffer is a ring of 100 and it floods during an error storm — the
 *     SDK's own submissions and the page's error pixel evicted every user
 *     action on a real site. So the ring is 500 deep, the SDK's own traffic is
 *     filtered out of it, and metrics pings are off entirely.
 *
 * The page URL is in neither the trail nor the object's attributes by default,
 * so the first crumb records it under `pageUrl` — the key the compiler reads.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS SCRUBBED FIRST. The submission token arrives as `?bt=…` so it
 * need not sit in a public repository, which means it is in `location.href` —
 * and the SDK records `document.location` on every navigation. Left alone, the
 * token would be written into the crash data, then into the journey compiled
 * from it, then into whatever pull request or ticket quoted that journey. A
 * credential must not travel that way.
 *
 * Scrubbing only the fields this module sets is NOT enough, and the test that
 * says so is the reason this comment exists: the SDK adds `location.href`,
 * `referrer` and `document.baseURI` by itself. So the last word is
 * `beforeSend`, which sees the finished report — every attribute, whoever put
 * it there — and is the only place that can promise the token does not leave
 * the page inside the payload.
